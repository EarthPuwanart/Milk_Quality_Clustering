# Milk_Quality_Clustering

A group project of 4 members for the course Unsupervised Machine Learning aims to develop clustering models, including K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN, to classify milk quality. 

The dataset is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cpluzshrijayan/milkquality/data. 

My primary responsibility is data preparation for input into the algorithms.
